## Features Implementation

Fill up the table below based on the **features** that you want us to grade you with. You may implement more features than what you can afford as your feature points, so you can select the features that we can grade. Feature prerequisite rule should apply.

You are free to transform the table below into short paragraphs if you’d like. The goal is to ensure that we **can find** and **confirm** each node implementation.

### Feature Tree Visual Representation

Download the feature tree image and indicate the nodes that you have implemented. Display an image of your completed feature tree here, highlight or circle the **nodes** that you have implemented as a visual aid for us when we grade your submission

### Feature Analysis

For **each** of your **orange**, **pink** and **purple** nodes, explain clearly your game design justification on how this feature upgrades the **overall quality** of the game. In short, you’re providing a short **analysis**.

- If the feature stated that it has to support a core drive, explain which core drive.
- If the feature does not state anything concrete, it becomes an **open ended feature. Please** use proper terminologies whenever possible.
  - You can argue that this feature forms an **elegant rule**, or
  - It improves the UX of the game, or
  - **It improves code maintenance** overall
- Consult our lecture slides for inspiration and samples on how to concisely **analyse** a game.
